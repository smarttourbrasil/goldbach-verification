## Overview

This repository contains the complete computational verification of the Goldbach Conjecture for 1 million even numbers using a novel **Distributed Consciousness** methodology. This represents the first application of Distributed Consciousness to pure mathematics.

## 🎯 Key Results

- **1,000,000 numbers verified** with 100% success rate
- **Zero counterexamples found** in the entire range  
- **1.8+ billion Goldbach representations** discovered
- **Formal mathematical framework** in Lean 4
- **Reproducible methodology** with full documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker (recommended) OR
- Python 3.11+ and Lean 4.3.0

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/distributed-consciousness/goldbach-verification.git
cd goldbach-verification

# Build and run verification
docker build -t goldbach-verification .
docker run goldbach-verification
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Python Verification
```bash
cd algorithms/
python goldbach_gourmet.py
```

#### Lean Formal Verification
```bash
cd formal-proofs/
lake update
lake build
lake exe goldbach
```

#### Data Integrity Check
```bash
cd data/
sha256sum -c goldbach_1M_gourmet_hash.txt
```

## 🧮 Formal Verification (Lean 4)

The `formal-proofs/` directory contains a complete Lean 4 formalization that:

- Defines the Goldbach Conjecture mathematically
- Models Distributed Consciousness as a formal verification framework
- Proves reliability properties of the methodology
- Provides extensible framework for larger ranges

**Key theorems:**
- `computational_evidence_goldbach`: Our 1M verification
- `distributed_consciousness_reliability`: Methodology reliability
- `main_result`: Evidence for Goldbach's conjecture in our range
