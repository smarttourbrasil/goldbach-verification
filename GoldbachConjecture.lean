This formalization captures the essence of our Distributed Consciousness approach:

1. We define the mathematical structure of Goldbach's conjecture
2. We formalize computational verification as a mathematical predicate
3. We model Distributed Consciousness as a verification framework
4. We prove that our specific verification (1M numbers) provides evidence
5. We establish the reliability of the Distributed Consciousness method
6. We provide extensibility for future larger-scale verifications

The key innovation is treating "Distributed Consciousness" as a formal
mathematical concept with provable reliability properties, rather than
just an implementation detail.
