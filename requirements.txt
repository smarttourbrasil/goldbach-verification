# Python dependencies for Goldbach Conjecture verification
# Distributed Consciousness methodology

# Core dependencies (minimal for basic verification)
# Note: The algorithm uses only Python standard library
# These are optional for enhanced functionality

# For data analysis (optional)
# numpy>=1.21.0
# pandas>=1.3.0

# For visualization (optional)  
# matplotlib>=3.4.0
# seaborn>=0.11.0

# For performance profiling (optional)
# memory-profiler>=0.60.0

# No external dependencies required for core verification
# The goldbach_gourmet.py script uses only Python standard library:
# - math (for sqrt, log)
# - json (for data serialization)
# - hashlib (for SHA-256)
# - time (for performance measurement)
# - sys (for system operations)
